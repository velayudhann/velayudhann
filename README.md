Text :
    Bold
        This formatting is achieved by wrapping the desired text to be in bold with double "*".
        Remember not to have spaces between the opening or closing markdown.
          Example -> This text here is **bold**
    Italic
        Very similar to bold, but with single "*" to achieve italic text:   
        Example -> This text here is *italic*
    Strikethrough
        Similar to bold but using double "~"  and this shows the text is now out of date:   
        Example -> This text here is ~~strikethrough~~
